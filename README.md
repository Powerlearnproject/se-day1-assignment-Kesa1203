#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science  that deals with writting of code, development of applications, testing of applications and their maintenance. 
Software engineering is important because it fosters the followin:
1.Innovation and Collaboration- individuals can work on projects from different locations with the use of platforms such as Github at a given time reducing cost while promoting development and fostering productivity.
2.Security-it ensures that people's or organization's sensitive information or data is kept safe from attacks by using features like factor aunthetication and encryptions.
3. Effiiciency- helps promote developer workflow whilest maintaining quality

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.Birth of Software Engineering (1960s)- it was as a descipline, systematic process, moving away from the ad-hoc coding to structered methodologies to address software crisis( projects were failing due to poor quality, delays, and budget overruns)
2.Structured Programming & Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s)-Emphasized modular code avoiding complexity through loops and conditionals also introduced reusable code and concepts like inheritance or encapsulation.
3.Agile & DevOps (2000s to present)-prioritized iterative development, customer collaboration and flexibility, merged development and operations automating workflows.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements-gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2.Design-Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3.Implementation-Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4.Testing-Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5.Deployment-Releasing the software to users or customers.
6.Maintenance-Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodologies- are a linear, sequantial,rigid,limited customer involvement development approach where it goes in stages one after the other, these are usually used for predictable, regulated and document heavy projects for example banking software and healthcare software
Agile methodologies- iterative, highly flexible development approach where there is continuous collaboration with stakeholders to address risks that might be encountered during the early developmental stages. Examples include instagram or chatgpt 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer-Responsible for writing code,debbugging and testing, design and architecture,documentation and implementing software solutions.
2.Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures software quality by designing,defect tracking,continuous improvement and executing test plans.
3.Project Manager-Oversees the planning, stakeholder engagement,progress tracking, team leadership, execution, and delivery of software projects.



Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts for example Eclipse and Visual Studio Code.

Code editing and Navigation- IDEs provide advanced code editors that offer syntax highlighting, code completion, and intelligent navigation like jumping to definitions. This helps developers write code faster and with fewer errors.
Integrated TTesting Support-IDEs often include support for unit testing frameworks, making it easier to write and run tests directly from the IDE.
Collaboration Feautures- some IDEs support features like collaborative coding or integrations with cloud services, enabling teams to work together more efficiently

Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members for example Git.
Code Collaboration-VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other's changes. They can work on separate branches and merge their contributions later.
Change Tracking-VCS tracks changes made to the codebase over time, enabling developers to view history, compare versions, and understand how the project has evolved
Backup and Recovery-By storing file versions, VCS protects against data loss. If a mistake is made, developers can revert to a previous version of the code easily.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Reapid technological advancements- continuous learning and upskilling to keepup with the evolving industry.
2.Time Constraints- prioritize tasks and set realistic deadlines.
3.Unclear Requirements-use agile methodologies that promote stakeholder involvement.
4.Collaboration and Communication-use effective communication platforms like slack and hold regular meetings to maintain clear communication and track progress.
5.Burnout and Work-life imbalance-maintain work-life boundaries including taking breaks and time off to recharge and also encourage a supportive culture.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing- involves testing individual components or modules of software. It assists in early bug detection, facilitates refactorig and simplifies debugging
Integration Testing- Involves testing of communications and interactions between different components or subsystems to ensure that they work together correctly.It assists in identifying interface issues and improves system functionality.
System Testing- Involves testing the entire software system as a whole evaluating the system's compliance with functional and non-functional requirements. It provides end to end validation and verifies system behaviour.
Acceptance Testing- Involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.Ths ensures user needs are met and it acts as the final check before release.




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering refers to the practice of designing and optimizing prompts—the inputs provided to AI models—to elicit the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses.The primary goal of prompt engineering is to improve the performance of AI models by framing questions, instructions, or statements in a way that guides the model towards producing desired outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt
Draw a picture of a child
Improved prompt
Draw a picture of an African boy child who is 13 years old wearing a school uniform and carrying a school bag who has short black hair. 
Clarity-The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (an African boy child who is 13) rather than just a "child".
Specific Details-Describing the boy's appearance (short black hair,school uniform, school bag).
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
